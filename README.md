user_sql
========

Owncloud SQL authentification

This is plugin is heavily based on user_imap, user_pwauth and user_ldap!

Enable it in your Admin -> Apps section and configure your server's details.
Currently, it only works with mySQL and the crypt() password encryption string. 
It was tested and developed for a postfixadmin database.
